# Alien-Invasion
Alien-themed website for students enrolled in a Psychology Statistics course to find directions and guidelines for their assignments.

This is part of a larger research project that looks at the idea of gamifying elements of education. Hence the aliens and playfulness.

It was my first project using HTML/CSS. Given most of the content, I designed the layout according to how I saw fit, and how it would be most clear to the students.
